1. Whats the input and output clock for vga controller?
2. What pixel data i.e red, green, blue u r sending out?
3. What image u r trying to display?
4. Whats the resolution of output image and display monitor?


1. The input clock to main module is 50Mhz but the controller works on 25Mhz clock. We have made a frequency divider to half the frequency of clock. At its output is used to process the vga controller
2. We are sending 1's to vga_red, green and blue signals, to display white color.
3. Just a white color screen.
4. The output image is 640*480 but the display monitor is 16:9 wide 1920*1080. But we changed the settings still nothing appears. Is the code written is correct or not?
